title: x64dbg Plugin For Detection of Obfuscated Module Loading
published: true
---

So Valve Anti Cheat dynamically streams modules with some part of their running code. The `steamclient.dll` executes a method that partially loads code from the internet and executes it while running so that the user does not see the full Anti Cheawt Library. 

In the context of loading modules and streaming parts of code over the internet we want to automate the location of modules that get loaded during runtime in Windows. 

We also in addition use the `ScyllaHide` plugin to circumvent popular mechanisms of detecting debuggers. 

# Writing a x64dbg Plugin

We take inspiration from x64dbg dev `mrexodia` and scan our registers to break when a ceratain condition is met. The idea was partially taken from http://lausiv.tech/posts/1 who discovered how modules are loaded during runtime in Valve Anti Cheat.

# Plugin README

Plugin to find Injection points of PE files during runtime. 

## 1 How it works 

## 2 Build

For building the x86 plugin select the properties 
* `msbuild .\find-pe-inject.sln -property:Configuration=Debug -property:Platform=x86`
and for building the x64 plugin choose 
* `msbuild .\find-pe-inject.sln -property:Configuration=Debug -property:Platform=x64`.

You can link the plugin with `mklink` on Windows to create a soft link for development
