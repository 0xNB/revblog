<p>Valve Anti Cheat is an userland Anti Cheat made to scan and detect external cheats (other processes) or internal cheats (in game processes).</p>

<p>As it is a userland level anticheat tool that means that it usually runs within the process that its meant to protect. It also can only monitor other user-land software whilst kernel level cheats can not be detected from user land.</p>

<p>VAC anti cheat thus can not detect hardware cheats (unless they are visible from userland) or kernel-land cheats (only enumerate list of drivers, check names and signatures and lower the trust factor sent to Valve if you allow unsigned drivers)</p>
